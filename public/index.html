				<p>Elbie is a Discord bot designed to run basic rules-lite TTRPGs by automating skill rolls, levelling, and a host of other stuff that keeps you looking at your sheet instead of engaging in the game. Make a wisdom check with '+s wis' instead of having to remember your modifiers. Get a personalized shorthand character sheet with '+who'. A host of other commands are available too, with one feature that distinguishes her from the majority of discord bots: nothing gross.</p>
				<p>To invite Elbeanor to your server, click <a href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=255390394219626496&scope=bot">here</a> and select a server on which you have "Manage Server" permissions.</p>
